# Docker Setup
We will be using Docker to provide the same development environment across your team. This will eliminate aggravating environment troubleshooting in different Operating Systems. We will not be using Docker in production since deployment using Heroku is easier.
## Prereqs
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/#time-based-release-schedule) â€“ if you are running Linux, install the Server version and install [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose)<br>
That's it! For Mac, you will see a Docker icon on the top bar, indicating that docker is running. 
## Our Docker Configuration
We have two Docker Images: 
- ```app```: Our Flask Application
- ```postgres```: Postgres Database
Note: A new directory called ```postgres-data``` will be created. *DO NOT DELETE!!* It holds all your data in your database.
## Setup
Check if you have installed Docker and Docker-Compose(Installing Docker on Mac/Windows will automatically install Docker-Compose):
```
$ docker -v
Docker version 17.09.1-ce, build 19e2cf6
$ docker-compose -v
docker-compose version 1.17.1, build 6d101fb
```
Now build the Docker images(the flask app and postgres database) and setup the database:
```
$ docker-compose build
$ docker-compose up -d
$ docker-compose exec api python manage.py recreate_db
```
Check if your Docker Containers are running:
```
$ docker ps
```
Now go to ```http://localhost:5000``` and you should see the app running!
## Common Docker commands
Stop the API and Postgres Containers
```

```
docker-compose stop
```
List all Containers
```
docker ps
```
Stop all Containers
```
docker stop $(docker ps -a)
```
Remove all images
```
docker rmi $(docker images -q)
```
Bash in a certain container, ie: ```api```
```
docker-compose run api bash
```
You can also run bash if you have the container's id. To get a container's id, do ```docker ps```
```
docker exec -it [CONTAINER_ID] /bin/bash
```
Or run a specific bash command, id: ```ls```
```
docker exec -it [CONTAINER_ID] ls
```
Docker Images, what you get when you ```docker-compose build``` are snapshots of your code at that certain time
Docker Containers are .....
